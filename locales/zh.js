As a public chain based on DAG technology, Vite proposes a forward-looking point of view of joint governance, and publicly selects high-quality talents with ability, condition, responsibility and ideal blockchain. As the candidate for Vite nodes, the following three points are bit dimensions. Community development planning:',

In the context of the Internet, where the demographic dividend is gradually fading, and the once-popular but eclipsed sharing economy, the blockchain focuses on assisting the transformation and upgrading of the industry.

Solid technical skills and rich experience in the development and operation of blockchain projects have made our bit dimension team more confident to be able to work on Vite nodes. At the same time, there are also Vite and Loopring positions among team members, which is a solid guideline protocol. Advocates and enthusiasts;',

On the one hand, the bit-dimensional team with experience in node selection has a complete set of server resources, provides a series of technical support, and arranges real-time monitoring of nodes to ensure stable operation of the system; In the process of promoting Vite\'s ecological construction, the Bit Dimensional team currently has thousands of communities and mature ecological promotion and organization experience, and effectively uses the bit dimension public number, bit dimension financial website and other self-media channels and consulting communities. The technical community co-catalyzes, effectively promotes Vite, knows Vite in a popular way, understands Vite in depth, and enthusiastically joins Vite. Anyone who contributes to the bit-dimensional node, whether it is community construction or technical maintenance, will be 20% of the proceeds are incentives and 5% are outstanding contributions. And the Bit Dimensional team will also combine their own project comprehension, share technical documentation, answer and guide the Vite technology community. At the same time, the bit dimension has the experience of Dapp landing application development, and has developed distributed applications based on the underlying technology of eos and sidechain fibos. Currently, it has a deep understanding and familiarity with Vite related technical documents for the later application of ecological construction. get ready;',
          'Third, Be prepared for the rain. The Bit Dimensional Team firmly believes that in the context of the new era, the new journey, and the new mission, the blockchain revolution must be able to subvert the traditional, complex, over-centered, and inefficient system, serving more transparent and efficient And fair areas. Therefore, the bit-dimensional team is not only committed to node construction, but will use a more precise angle and more abundant power to make a combination of community construction and application development. In the future, the bit dimension team will implement “four more”. : Put forward more Vite project ideas, issue more applications, recruit more investment institutions, and recruit more people of insight.',

        question: 'Vite 公链和其它公链相比，最大的创新在哪里？',
        answer: [
          'Vite 最大的创新点是引入了异步的设置：',
          '第一，我们把智能合约的调用做了异步的拆分。Nano（DAG三驾马车之一）把一笔转账分为出账和入账两个动作。我们借鉴了Nano，把它扩展到转账及智能合约的调用上，把一笔转账交易拆分为出账和入账，把一个合约调用交易拆分为合约的请求交易和合约的响应交易两部分。',
          '第二个是写入和确认的一个异步的设计。在Vite中，一个交易被写入账本和一个交易被确认是异步的。传统的区块链（如比特币），交易写入账本的速度会受到打包速度的制约。而在Vite中，用户可以在TPS限额之内写入很多交易到账本，但交易是以匀速异步确认的，这样可以削平波峰波谷，最大化地利用系统的资源，提高整个系统的吞吐量。同时，两个账户之间的交易不会彼此堵塞，不会出现因为某一个账户发送了大量交易，使其他账户的交易长期得不到确认。',
          '第三个是合约间调用的异步设计。以太坊里的合约间调用是通过消息调用，或者叫内部交易的方式来完成的，这组调用要么同时完成，要么全部失败，这是一个原子性的ACID语义，会成为性能瓶颈。我们借鉴了一些中心化互联网技术中比较成熟的方案，采用了消息驱动的架构，合约之间不共享任何状态，只通过彼此发送消息来进行通信。'
        ]
      },
      {
        question: 'Vite的智能合约间调用取消了同步调用，那如何兼容以太里同步调用的场景？',

      },
      {
        question: 'Vite 的 Solidity++ 和以太的 Solidity 有什么区别？',
        answer: [
          '就像c和c++一样，solidity++的名字就是源自于此。在基本语法上，Solidity++和Solidity兼容，最大差异是消息调用的语义不同，以太代码里，是一个同步调用，在Solidity++里是异步调用。',

          '经过认真的研究，我们发现在实际场景中，强一致性语义是可以用BASE语义替代的。由于Vite的HDPoS共识算法可以保障交易确认在1秒之内完成，因此，延迟的增加仍然在可控范围之内。'

          '这种DAG结构有先天的安全性缺陷。这是由于交易是按账户分组的，一个交易只会附加到其所属账户的账户链末端，其他账户产生的交易不会自动成为该交易的后继节点，因此，一些交易被回滚的概率不会随时间推移而降低。Vite通过独创的快照链技术，弥补了这一缺陷。'

        answer: [
          'Vite的资产发行类似于以太的ERC20，但本质有所不同。ERC20是一个规范，而不是以太坊协议的一部分。在以太坊中发行新代币，需要用户开发和部署一个智能合约，代币的余额维护在该合约的状态中。一旦合约开发有所疏漏，就会产生安全风险。例如用户忘记引用SaftMath库，就可能产生溢出漏洞。而Vite的代币发行是内置在Vite协议中的，代币余额维护在用户账户的状态中，新代币和Vite原生代币共享转账底层协议，具有和Vite原生代币同样的安全性。用户在Vite中发行新代币，只需要发起一个交易，将新代币参数放在交易的data字段中，不需要写合约代码，这样也就不容易产生安全漏洞。',
