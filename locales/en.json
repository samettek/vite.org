The Bit Dimensional Team firmly believes that in the context of the new era, the new journey, and the new mission, the blockchain revolution must be able to subvert the traditional, complex, over-centered, and inefficient system, serving more transparent and efficient And fair areas. Therefore, the bit-dimensional team is not only committed to node construction, but will use a more precise angle and more abundant power to make a combination of community construction and application development. In the future, the bit dimension team will implement “four more”. : Put forward more Vite project ideas, issue more applications, recruit more investment institutions, and recruit more people of insight.",

Due to Vite’s asynchronous model, transactions are processed at a relatively steady rate, thus reducing the peaks and troughs typically associated with traditional models limited by their packing speed.

If contract development is flawed, security risks surface. For example, if a user forgets to refer to the SaftMath library, an overflow may occur. Vite token is built into the Vite protocol. The token balance is maintained in the state of the user's account. The new token and the Vite native token share the same underlying protocol thus bringing the same measure of security to the new token and native token. When a user decides to issue a new token in Vite, all they need to do is initiate a transaction. The transaction then puts the new token parameters in the transaction data.
