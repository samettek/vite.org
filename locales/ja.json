And the Bit Dimensional team will also combine their own project comprehension, share technical documentation, answer and guide the Vite technology community. At the same time, the bit dimension has the experience of Dapp landing application development, and has developed distributed applications based on the underlying technology of eos and sidechain fibos. Currently, it has a deep understanding and familiarity with Vite related technical documents for the later application of ecological construction. get ready;",

The Bit Dimensional Team firmly believes that in the context of the new era, the new journey, and the new mission, the blockchain revolution must be able to subvert the traditional, complex, over-centered, and inefficient system, serving more transparent and efficient And fair areas. Therefore, the bit-dimensional team is not only committed to node construction, but will use a more precise angle and more abundant power to make a combination of community construction and application development.

                "answer": [
                    "The biggest innovation is the asynchronous design, which can be understood in three aspects: ",
                    "First, we are introducing the concept of asynchronous design into smart contracts.  The Nano project (one of three well-known chains that use DAG) separates a transfer action into a send and a receive transaction. We are building upon this mechanism, and will separate the call and the response of a smart contract, so they can take place asynchronously.",
                    "Second, the writing and verification of a transaction also happen asynchronously in Vite.  In traditional blockchain setup (e.g., Bitcoin), the speed of writing transactions into a ledger is limited by the speed of packing.  But Vite allows writing of many transactions into the ledger within the constraints of the TPS.  Because the asynchronous setup allows the transactions to happen at an even speed, this reduces the peaks and troughs of the speed of transaction writing, thus optimizing usage of resources and increasing system throughput.  Also, the transactions of two users will no longer be blocked; that is, we will no longer see a scenario where a user sends a large amount of transactions that prevents the transactions of other users from taking place.",
                    "Third, calls between contracts will also happen asynchronously in Vite.  The calls between smart contracts in Ethereum are implemented through messaging (aka insider transactions); and the calls either all succeed or all fail, as per an atomic ACID semantic.  To solve for this bottleneck in performance, we take a page from well-developed solutions in centralized Internet technologies, and will make use of a message-driven architecture.  As such, contracts do not share states and communicate via messages."

                    "On a high level, the differences are similar to those of C and C++.  In basic syntax, the two languages are largely compatible.  The largest difference is in the synchronous (Ethereum) vs asynchronous (Vite) calls as mentioned earlier.",

                    "After rigorous research, we find that in practical use cases, strong consistency semantics can be replaced by BASE semantics.

Transactions are divided into two types: \"request transactions\" and \"response transactions.”  A response transaction needs to quote the corresponding hash of the request transaction.",
                    "The DAG structure has an inherent deficiency in security. This is because transactions are grouped by accounts, and each transaction is only attached to the chain associated with the relevant account. Transactions generated by other accounts do not automatically become the subsequent nodes of the previous transaction. Therefore, for some transactions, the rollback probability will not drop over time.  The Snapshot chain technology is meant to address this issue."

                    "Vite has taken Solidity's problems into account and has adopted countermeasures when designing smart contracts. These operational improvements are seen within our Solidity++ language. One of those improvements, for example, would be the incorporation of a series of standard libraries. This serves a dual purpose of increasing security protection while simplifying programming complexity. Because Solidity++ inter-contract calls rely on asynchronous architecture, the attacks facilitated by contract synchronous calls are inherently prevented. The classic Ethereum example of a \"reentrancy attack\" scenario is not applicable in Vite's case. Vite will implement contractual formal verification technology to tackle smart contract development and we are considering offering a smart contract solution based on WASM. In short, we present users with a variety of solution-based options. "

                    "Vite's asset issuance is similar to ERC20, but in other ways it is different. ERC20 is a specification, but not a part of the Ethereum protocol. The issuance of new tokens with Ethereum requires the user to develop and deploy a smart contract. Token balance is maintained by the state of the contract. If contract development is flawed, security risks surface. For example, if a user forgets to refer to the SaftMath library, an overflow may occur. Vite token is built into the Vite protocol. The token balance is maintained in the state of the user's account. The new token and the Vite native token share the same underlying protocol thus bringing the same measure of security to the new token and native token. When a user decides to issue a new token in Vite, all they need to do is initiate a transaction. The transaction then puts the new token parameters in the transaction data. The fact that our network does not require smart contract writing inherently leaves less room for bug generation to occur."
