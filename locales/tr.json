          "2018 is destined to be an extraordinary year. Under the bright sunshine of the great transformation of the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up, the blockchain field has gradually penetrated into all walks of life and exerted its \"credit value\" function. Looking back at the 2017 chain and the currency circle, there is no doubt that \"a big Yangxian can change the belief\", \"as long as you buy and hold, you can lie down and make money\" hot market, but the tide will eventually recede, the economic market No one can guarantee that compared with the chain and the currency circle, it is necessary to effectively reflect the value of the team, accelerate the integration with the real economy, and cooperate with the common promotion of policies, technologies and markets to optimize the traditional industrial model and help the high quality. development of. As a public chain based on DAG technology, Vite proposes a forward-looking point of view of joint governance, and publicly selects high-quality talents with ability, condition, responsibility and ideal blockchain. As the candidate for Vite nodes, the following three points are bit dimensions. Community development planning:",
          "The first, It is imperative. In the context of the Internet, where the demographic dividend is gradually fading, and the once-popular but eclipsed sharing economy, the blockchain focuses on assisting the transformation and upgrading of the industry. When the bit dimension succeeds as one of the Vite nodes, our team or community will follow. The official pace of Vite, in conjunction with the official completion of the node's responsibilities, participate in the Vite node co-construction and optimization steps. The Vite node is only one part of the community construction. The members of the Bit Dimensional team have doubled computer science and technology and financial economics, are proficient in various computer development languages, have more than five years of experience in the financial industry, and coincide with the blockchain field. Solid technical skills and rich experience in the development and operation of blockchain projects have made our bit dimension team more confident to be able to work on Vite nodes. At the same time, there are also Vite and Loopring positions among team members, which is a solid guideline protocol. Advocates and enthusiasts;",
          "Second, Take a multi-pronged approach. Community and ecological construction need both hard and soft. On the one hand, the bit-dimensional team with experience in node selection has a complete set of server resources, provides a series of technical support, and arranges real-time monitoring of nodes to ensure stable operation of the system; In the process of promoting Vite's ecological construction, the Bit Dimensional team currently has thousands of communities and mature ecological promotion and organization experience, and effectively uses the bit dimension public number, bit dimension financial website and other self-media channels and consulting communities. The technical community co-catalyzes, effectively promotes Vite, knows Vite in a popular way, understands Vite in depth, and enthusiastically joins Vite. Anyone who contributes to the bit-dimensional node, whether it is community construction or technical maintenance, will be 20% of the proceeds are incentives and 5% are outstanding contributions. And the Bit Dimensional team will also combine their own project comprehension, share technical documentation, answer and guide the Vite technology community. At the same time, the bit dimension has the experience of Dapp landing application development, and has developed distributed applications based on the underlying technology of eos and sidechain fibos. Currently, it has a deep understanding and familiarity with Vite related technical documents for the later application of ecological construction. get ready;",
          "Third, Be prepared for the rain. The Bit Dimensional Team firmly believes that in the context of the new era, the new journey, and the new mission, the blockchain revolution must be able to subvert the traditional, complex, over-centered, and inefficient system, serving more transparent and efficient And fair areas. Therefore, the bit-dimensional team is not only committed to node construction, but will use a more precise angle and more abundant power to make a combination of community construction and application development. In the future, the bit dimension team will implement “four more”. : Put forward more Vite project ideas, issue more applications, recruit more investment institutions, and recruit more people of insight.",
          "We always believe that Vite will be the leader, not only bringing the next bull market, but also leading the blockchain era, and the bit dimension, more depth!"

          "3. Create multiple vite WeChat groups or telegraph groups, and continuously acquire new vite fans through diversified dapps developed by the team."

Vite allows the writing of many transactions into the ledger simultaneously without waiting for confirmation. Due to Vite’s asynchronous model, transactions are processed at a relatively steady rate, thus reducing the peaks and troughs typically associated with traditional models limited by their packing speed. Additionally, with this setup there will no longer be situations in which a user that sends large numbers of transactions will prevent the completion of other users' transactions .

If contract development is flawed, security risks surface. For example, if a user forgets to refer to the SaftMath library, an overflow may occur. Vite token is built into the Vite protocol. The token balance is maintained in the state of the user's account. The new token and the Vite native token share the same underlying protocol thus bringing the same measure of security to the new token and native token. When a user decides to issue a new token in Vite, all they need to do is initiate a transaction. The transaction then puts the new token parameters in the transaction data.

The gateway passed a strict audit conducted by a well-known security firm, and no security vulnerabilities were found. In Vite 2.0, we will provide a separate decentralized cross-chain protocol to ensure that cross-chain value transfers are more secure and efficient."
